# Uber Data Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of Uber rides to gain insights into user behavior and patterns.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about Uber rides, including:

- Start and end dates and times
- Pickup and dropoff locations
- Trip distances (miles)
- Ride purposes (business, personal, etc.)
- Ride categories (business, personal, etc.)


## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are to:

- Explore the dataset and identify key variables.
- Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.
- Visualize the data to uncover patterns and trends.
- Answer specific questions about Uber ride patterns.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Import necessary libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
   - Load the Uber dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Handle missing values and convert data types as needed.
   - Create new columns for date, time, and day/night categories.

2. **Data Visualization and Exploration:**
   - Create visualizations to answer specific questions, such as:
      - Which category of users book the most rides?
      - What are the most common ride purposes?
      - When are Uber rides booked most frequently (time of day)?
      - In which month are Uber rides booked less frequently?
      - On which day of the week are Uber rides booked the most?
      - What is the typical distance of an Uber ride?

3. **Insights and Observations:**
   - Summarize the key findings from the data analysis.
   - Provide insights into Uber user behavior and ride patterns.
   - Draw conclusions based on the observed trends.
