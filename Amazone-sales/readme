# Amazon Sales Report Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes an Amazon Sales Report to gain insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. 

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis is from an Amazon Sales Report CSV file (`Amazon Sale Report.csv`). The file contains information about orders, including order date, product details, customer information, and shipping details.


## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The following steps were taken to clean and preprocess the data:

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Null values were removed to ensure data quality.
2. **Data Type Conversion:** Columns with incorrect data types were converted to their appropriate types (e.g., `ship-postal-code` to integer).
3. **Column Renaming:** Columns were renamed for better readability and consistency (e.g., 'Qty' to 'Quantity').
4. **Dropping Irrelevant Columns:** Unrelated or blank columns were dropped (e.g., 'New', 'PendingS').

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis involved the following explorations:

1. **Size Analysis:** Analyzed the distribution of sizes purchased by customers, revealing M-Size as the most popular.
2. **Courier Status:** Examined the courier status of orders and their relationship to order status, showing a majority of orders shipped.
3. **Category Analysis:** Explored the distribution of product categories, highlighting T-shirts as the most purchased category.
4. **B2B Analysis:** Determined the proportion of B2B buyers (0.7%) compared to retailers (99.3%).
5. **Fulfillment Analysis:** Investigated the fulfillment channels used, indicating Amazon as the primary method.
6. **State-wise Distribution:** Analyzed the distribution of orders across different states, with Maharashtra leading the sales.
