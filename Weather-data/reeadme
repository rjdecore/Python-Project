# Weather Data Analysis

This Google Colab notebook analyzes a weather dataset to answer various questions about weather patterns, including wind speed, visibility, and temperature.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is named `file.csv` and is assumed to be located in the `/content/` directory within the Colab environment. It contains information about weather conditions over a period of time, including columns such as 'Date/Time', 'Temp_C', 'Dew Point Temp_C', 'Rel Hum_%', 'Wind Speed_km/h', 'Visibility_km', 'Press_kPa', and 'Weather'.

## Analysis

The notebook performs the following analysis steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and displays basic information about its structure and descriptive statistics.
2. **Unique Wind Speeds:** Identifies and visualizes the unique wind speed values present in the dataset.
3. **Clear Weather Occurrences:** Calculates and visualizes the number of times the weather was recorded as 'Clear'.
4. **Wind Speed Frequency:** Determines and visualizes the frequency of wind speed being exactly 4 km/h.
5. **Null Value Detection:** Identifies and visualizes any missing values within the dataset.
6. **Column Renaming:** Renames the 'Weather' column to 'Weather Condition' for better clarity.
7. **Mean Visibility:** Calculates and visualizes the average visibility.
8. **Pressure Standard Deviation:** Calculates and visualizes the standard deviation of pressure.
9. **Relative Humidity Variance:** Calculates and visualizes the variance of relative humidity.
10. **Snow Occurrences:** Extracts and displays all instances where snow was recorded.
11. **Wind Speed and Visibility:** Identifies and displays instances where wind speed exceeded 24 km/h and visibility was 25 km.
12. **Mean Values by Weather Condition:** Calculates and displays the mean value of each column for each weather condition.
13. **Minimum and Maximum Values by Weather Condition:** Determines and displays the minimum and maximum values of each column for each weather condition.
14. **Foggy Weather Records:** Extracts and displays all records where the weather condition was 'Fog'.
15. **Combined Weather Conditions:** Extracts and displays instances where the weather was 'Clear' or visibility exceeded 40 km.
16. **Specific Weather Conditions:** Extracts and displays instances where specific weather conditions were met, such as 'Clear' weather with relative humidity greater than 50% or visibility exceeding 40 km.


## Libraries Used

The analysis utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
- Seaborn: For enhancing visualizations.

## Usage

To run this notebook:

1. Upload the `file.csv` dataset to the `/content/` directory in your Colab environment.
2. Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially.
3. Observe the outputs and visualizations generated for each analysis step.
